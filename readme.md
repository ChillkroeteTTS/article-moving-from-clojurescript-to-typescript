After doing my first React Native application with Clojurescript, my next application felt like a good opportunity to revisit Javascript as I was tired of using the Clojurescript/JS interop with libraries clearly designed for another language than I was using.
As my last intensive contact with Javascript was 3 years ago, I was curious of how my own perspective and the language itself evolved. However, programming wouldn't be programming if this project wouldn't have its pitfalls prepared for me. By sharing my experience I hope to spare you from some mistakes I did.

After my time with Clojure I didn't want to miss concepts like the great state management I was used from [(re-frame)](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), Clojures immutable datastructures and a flexible way to assert the structure they have [(clojure.spec)](https://clojure.org/about/spec).
Luckily I found promising counterparts in Javascript. Namely [redux (State Management)](https://redux.js.org/), [Immutable.JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Setting them up was pretty straightforward and especially Typescript amazed me by not forcing you into some tight rule corset - if you don't feel the need to type everything, just turn the rule off.
The only thing I couldn't find a replacement for is my precious REPL, but you can't have everything I guess... But let's get started

## Main Differences

In this part I want to talk briefly about the main differences between the aforementioned Clojurescript+re-frame tech stack and Typescript+redux. If you are familiar with Javascript/React (Native)/Redux you can easily skip this section. Also this is far from a thorough guide and does not replace a good look into each technologies documentation.

### Redux

Coming from re-frame, understanding redux is easy. You can compare re-frames 'dominoes' directly to the concepts of redux. What is the `app-state` for re-frame is the `store` for redux. However there are a few things to consider:

- Instead of beeing managed by the re-frame library, redux's `store` is an object created by yourself with `const store = createStore(reducer)`.
- Mutating your state happens by explicit calls to the object methods of your store. In theory you could have multiple store in your application... However don't do something just because you can. The creators of re-frame [explain](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/ApplicationState.md) way better than I ever could why it's a good idea to have your state in one place.
- As a result I distinguish between the `store` and the `state` where the former controls the mutation of the latter.

**1st Domino: Event Dispatch**

What re-frame describes as `event` is in redux an `action` which is a JS object containing the key 'type', e.g. `{type: 'logout'}`.
Actions are dispatched by a function literally called `store.dispatch(action)`

**2nd/3rd Domino: Event/Effect Handling**

Instead of registering different event handlers as in re-frame, redux passes each action to a function given to the store while creation. This function is called a `reducer`. The reducer takes the current snapshot of the state and the action to be handled as parameters, computes a new state version based on the action's 'type' property and returns it. More about how I designed my reducer function comes later in [#Adding Reducers](#adding-reducers).

**4th Domino: Query**

It is worth mentioning that in theory redux's functionality ends here with providing the `store.subscribe(listener)` function. This subscribe function is not to be confused with the one re-frame provides and much more low-level. In redux `subscribe` registers a state listener which is called **any time** the state **might** have changed. For comparison components using re-frame's `subscribe` function are re-rendered only if the part of the state that's of interest actually changed.

A better comparison (and commonly used) is [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux).
It provides you with the `connect(mapStateToProps)(yourComponent)` function which returns you a wrapped version of your component. This wrapped version's props contain injected data from your state as defined in your `mapStateToProps` function.

_Example using connect() and mapStateToProps()_

```
const mapStateToProps = (state: State) => {
  return {
    noEmptyNames: state.names.filter(str=>str!=="")
  }
}

const MyUnmappedComponent(props) {
  return <View> {props.noEmptyNames.map(person => <Person key={person.name} name={person.name} />)} </View>
}

export const MyComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)(MyUnmappedComponent)
```

**5th Domino: View**

_Example simple JSX:_

```
return <Text>2+2={2+2}</Text> /* Evaluates to 2+2=4 */
```

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is an HTML like syntax extension used to describe your React (Native) UI. Formerly using [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) I do had some moments where I missed having simple lists for this but JSX really does a good job. It compiles to function calls and thus can be handled (almost) as easily as any other first class citizen.

_Example JSX as datastructure:_

```
  const persons = List(['Lucy', 'Andrew']);
  const personsJsx = persons.map(name => <Person key={name} name={name} />)
  return <View> {personsJsx} </View>
```

### The Struggle with **this**

For all our stateful components we need to create classes so they can hold the UI state. Maybe it's just me but intuitively I would say the following looks rock solid:

```
class ThisIsAwesome extends Component<any> {
  state: {toggle:boolean}
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {toggle:false}
  }

  switchToggle() {this.setState({ toggle: !this.state.toggle })}

  render() {
	  <Button onPress={this.switchToggle2}>
	  <Text>{this.state.toggle.toString()}</Text>
	  </Button>
  }
}
```

However for Javascript the **this** in the switchToggle function refers to the Button object which leads to an exception because Button misses a state member named 'toggle'. I saw some people fixing this by binding each functions **this** in the constructor:

```
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { toggle: false };
  this.switchToggle = this.switchToggle.bind(this);
}
```

In my opinion this is not just tedious, but also error prone(easy to forget) and also doesn't fit in our immutable world.
Instead I use an arrow function for each and every class function. This way I can stop thinking about this matter.

```
switchToggle2 = () => { this.setState({ toggle: !this.state.toggle }) }
```

### Adding Reducers

I didn't like the way redux handles actions with a giant [switch statement](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers#handling-actions).
Redux proposes an [alternative](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducingboilerplate#generating-reducers) which is nice because it offers pluggable action handlers. However complex action handlers need to be defined in a dedicated function with which I end up having 2 places to edit: the function definition and the mapping from action type to function.

I ended up using an approach similar to reframe where I can dynamically register reducers during runtime:

```
type ActionFn = (state: State, action: Action) => State;

let wiring = Map<ActionType, ActionFn>();

export function registerReducer(type: ActionType, fn: ActionFn) {
  wiring = wiring.set(type, fn);
  return type;
}

function mainReducer(initialState: State, state: State, action: Action) {
  if (typeof state === "undefined") return initialState;
  if (!wiring.has(action.type)) {
    const errStr = `Couldn't find action from type ${action.type}`
    log.error(errStr);
    throw errStr;
  } else {
    const reducer = wiring.get(action.type)!;
    const newState = reducer(state, action);
    if (newState == undefined) throw `State returned by reducer ${action.type} is faulty.";
    return newState;
  }
}

export function registerReducers() {
  clearReducers();
  registerReducer('testActionHandler', function (state: State) {
    return state.set('tested', true);
  });
}
```

This allowes for a different set of action handlers for testing and having the function definition in one place.

> To be honest there are still 2 places edit: the function definition/registering and the enum definition with the set of valid action types. However looking at it this way, redux proposal requires me to edit 3 places in the code.

## Marrying Typescript with Immutable.js

Holding your state in an immutable datastructure makes me feel a lot safer while rushing through my code at 2am. However, although Immutable.js provides proper type definitions for itâ€™s exported Objects, Typescript's type system describes the structure of plain JS Objects, not the key-value pairs your immutable.Map object contains. Expecting to work in an error safe environment this was a real bummer for me.

### What I Expected

- auto-completion and validation of datastructures
- auto-completion and validation of dispatched actions (type and parameters)
- one place to edit when adding a new datastructure
- one place to edit when adding a new reducer
- mockable reducers (and when I say mockable, I mean pluggable)
- having an immutable, typed state

### Typing Immutable Datastructures

Browsing StackOverflow the common solution to type immutable.Map seems to be to create 1. the interface for the mutable JS object and 2. an interface for the immutable.Map object which is expected to contain kv-pairs with the keys defined in the first

```
interface State {
  firstKey: boolean
  [..]
}
interface ImmutableDatastructure extends Map<string, any> {
  toJS(): State;
  get<K extends keyof State>(key: K): State[K];
}
```

However this would require me to duplicate a lot of code every time I add a new type. Instead I created a generic interface which describes this pattern for me:

```
interface ImmutableOf<T> extends Map<string, any> {
  toJS(): T;
  get<K extends keyof T>(key: K): T[K];
}
```

This way the type definition for the immutable.Map happens in one place:

```
export type Datastructure1 = ImmutableOf<{
  [..]
}>;

export type State = ImmutableOf<{
  firstKey: boolean
  nestedDs: Datastructure1
  [â€¦]
}>;
```

### Typing Reducers

For this we need two important types:

- the `Action` type describes the structure of a dispatchable action
- the `ActionType` describes which values the 'type' property of an action can take

By specifying the first while store creation

```
export const store: Store<State, Action> = createStore(mainReducer.bind(null, initialStore));
```

and the second in the [registerReducer()](#adding-reducers) definition, dispatching actions and registering reducers is typed.  
Question now is how `Action` and `ActionType` look.

My first approach was the following:

```
export enum ActionType {
  invalidateFirstStartup,
  appIsConfigured,
  removeProductFromSearchResult
}
export interface Action {
  type: ActionType,
  [x: string]: any
}
```

This way the action type when dispatching actions or registering reducers is validated and I got auto-completion. Also I have a single place for defining new action types. This worked very well for me until I added reducers with parameters. As to be expected this lead to numerous manual lookups for the exact parameter name and runtime errors while adding new parameters to old reducers. To fix this I came up with a second approach:

```
interface ActionWithoutParams {
  type: 'action1' | 'action2'
}

export interface Action3 {
  type: 'action3'
  param1: number
  param2: boolean
  [..]
}

export type Action = ActionWithoutParams | Action3

export type ActionType = Action['type']
```

This way everytime I add an action without params, I just add the action type to the `ActionWithoutParams` interface. Actions with params however require me to add a dedicated interface as well as to add this interface to the `Action` type definition. However the more work is totally worth it.
Whenever I try to dispatch an action with the action type 'action3', Typescript infers that 'param1' and 'param2' are also needed to be a valid object. Including auto-completion.

### What is Still Missing

The only thing I couldn't achieve so far is to touch only one place in my codebase to add a new reducer. In fact, when I add a reducer with parameters, there are 3 places to touch: registration, interface declaration for parameters, `Action` definition.
